		APE PROJECT LAUNCH PLAN


BEFORE YOU EDIT: 

- The folder $APE_HOME/resources/launch-plan is a TEMPLATE for future launch plans created and executed.
  Changes there get copied into every launch plan created by ape.  Edit with care!

- The folder $APE_HOME/tmp/launch-plan-${NAME} is a WORKING COPY of a specific launch plan created by an ape script.
  Changes there may not affect a launch already in progress (or could confuse cloudinitd).

- You can make a copy of the template and edit that to try changes to the template plan used.
  Use the option template= to specify:

	my_troop = Troop(template='/SOME/OTHER/TEMPLATE/LAUNCH-PLAN')


RELEVANT FILES:
